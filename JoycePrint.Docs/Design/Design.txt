TODO
------------------------------------------------

The site has to be a single page., like the wix site.
So change the nav control to point to further down the same page
The nav bar sections should highlight and update when the scrolled section changes

Create each of the views in as is now, with different controllers and different views
Load them all together in a master view file.
