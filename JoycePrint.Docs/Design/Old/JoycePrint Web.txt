MVC .NET - Back end logic

Angular.js - Front end logic
1.0.x Will work on IE 8
2.0.x Has dropped support for IE 8 and other browsers
	This is a way around having to write alot of useless front end auto update stuff
	It will probably not help with sending the validation calls back to the server so the MVC validation attributes can be used
